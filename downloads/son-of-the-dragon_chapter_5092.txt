Sang Tianyang’s brows furrowed even tighter, “Pavilion Master Tian, what brings you here?”

He had never been on good terms with the Master of Tianyuan Pavilion, and the two factions, Shura Hall and Tianyuan Pavilion, had been locked in open and covert struggles for years. The sudden appearance of the Pavilion Master was certainly no good news.

Ling Yunxiao didn’t respond, instead turning his gaze to the Great Elder, a faint glint flashing in his eyes, “The Great Elder of Shura Hall lives up to his reputation. That ‘Shura Annihilation’ move just now was truly earth-shaking, but what a pity…”

He shifted his tone, looking at Chen Ping, “You met this Chen Ping, who possesses rare treasures. Quite unfortunate.”

The Great Elder snapped his head up, eyeing the Pavilion Master with a trace of doubt.

The Pavilion Master continued, “This Chen Ping killed my prodigy, slew my elder, and shattered my phantom. Do you think fighting him will be easy?”

“Especially since even your Shura Hall Master has backed down. You’re just an elder, why persist?”

The Pavilion Master was clearly sowing discord!

Chen Ping sneered inwardly. This Pavilion Master was quite adept at stirring trouble.

The Great Elder’s expression flickered, then he turned to the Pavilion Master, “Pavilion Master Tian, this Chen Ping killed our Young Master and humiliated Shura Hall. Today, even if it costs me my life, I’ll tear him to pieces! If you’re willing to lend a hand, I’m ready to set aside past grudges with Tianyuan Pavilion!”

He never expected the Great Elder to propose cooperation with Tianyuan Pavilion, their sworn enemy.

“Great Elder, you’ve gone too far! Don’t you know Shura Hall and Tianyuan Pavilion have always been at odds?”

“And Chen Ping killed a member of our Sang family, my father’s son. Why are you so fixated on this?”

Chen Ping and Mo Qingyun were equally stunned. Chen Ping, who had been about to leave, decided to stay and hear what this was all about.

“Hahaha, Shura Hall has such secrets? Truly remarkable!” The Pavilion Master laughed heartily!

The Great Elder’s face darkened, but he didn’t deny Sang Tianyang’s words!

“Sang Qi was the son of your mother and the Great Elder. They thought they hid it perfectly, but I’ve known for a long time.”

“That’s why I went into seclusion and left Shura Hall in your hands.”

Hearing this, Sang Lan was utterly dumbfounded. She never imagined her elder brother wasn’t even her half-brother!

Upon hearing Sang Tianyang’s words, the Great Elder’s aura surged violently, dark purple battle energy swirling around him, as if decades of suppressed resentment and rage had finally burst forth.

He tore the Shura Token from his waist and hurled it to the ground, the crisp sound of the token shattering echoing harshly in the silent Liuli City sky.

“Sang Tianyang! Since you’ve laid it all bare today, I’m done hiding. Do you think I’ve endured all these years for nothing?”

His voice was hoarse, his eyes bloodshot, “She and I were childhood sweethearts, growing up at the foot of Shura Mountain, vowing to roam the Three Realms together. But you?”

He pointed furiously at Sang Tianyang, his finger trembling with rage, “Back then, you used your status as the Young Master of Shura Hall to force her to marry you, even though she was already carrying my child!”

Mo Qingyun instinctively tightened her grip on Chen Ping’s sleeve, while Sang Lan staggered back half a step, her face as pale as paper, “No… Impossible! Father isn’t that kind of person…”
