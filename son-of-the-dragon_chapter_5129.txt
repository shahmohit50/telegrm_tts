The leading elder, with white hair and beard, had a giant white feather atop his head, his face etched with the ravines of age. He was the Grand Elder of the Barbaric Ancient Clan, a powerhouse at the Eighth Grade of the Loose Immortal Realm!

The Grand Elder’s gaze, sharp as a hawk’s, landed on Yun Wuya, brimming with fury, “You’ve got some nerve! My Barbaric Ancient Clan has no dealings with your Qingyun Sect, yet you bring outsiders to trespass on our territory. Are you courting death?”

Yun Wuya’s legs buckled, nearly collapsing to the ground, stammering, “G-Great Elder, I… I’m here to bring this Mr. Chen…”

The Grand Elder sneered, his eyes sweeping over Chen Ping. Seeing his youthful, unremarkable appearance, he scoffed, “This wet-behind-the-ears kid? You call him ‘Mister’? Has your Qingyun Sect stooped to being dogs for others?”

Yun Wuya, mocked, didn’t dare retort. After all, compared to the Barbaric Ancient Clan, his Qingyun Sect was nothing!

“Is your Barbarian King missing?” Chen Ping raised an eyebrow, a playful smirk curling his lips.

The Grand Elder’s brows furrowed slightly, “How did you know?”

“A guess? Do you take me for a fool?” The Grand Elder’s anger flared, pointing at Yun Wuya’s nose, “Yun Wuya, you dare bring people to cause trouble? Believe me, I’ll twist your head off right now!”

Chen Ping cut him off impatiently, tired of the nonsense.

With a flick of his wrist, he produced a bloodied head, casually tossing it at the Grand Elder’s feet.

“You… who are you? How dare you act wildly in my Barbaric Ancient Clan’s territory…” The Grand Elder was about to explode when his gaze locked onto the head, his pupils shrinking sharply!

The head, with its ferocious features, belonged to none other than the leader of the Barbaric Ancient Clan, the Mountain-Splitting Barbarian King!

The surrounding barbarian warriors and elders erupted in chaos, staring at the head on the ground, their faces filled with shock and fear.

The Grand Elder, as if struck by lightning, stumbled back several steps, pointing at Chen Ping with a trembling voice, “Who… who killed His Majesty the Barbarian King?”

The Grand Elder couldn’t believe Chen Ping killed the Barbarian King. After all, Chen Ping was only at the Fifth Grade of the Loose Immortal Realm, while the Barbarian King was at the Ninth Grade, a vast gap in power!

Even if the Barbarian King stood still and let Chen Ping strike, Chen Ping shouldn’t have been able to kill him!

Chen Ping brushed his hands, as if he’d just tossed a common rock rather than the head of a Ninth Grade Loose Immortal, his tone calm and steady, “Of course, I killed him.”

The Grand Elder refused to believe, “You, a Fifth Grade Loose Immortal, how could you kill our Barbarian King!”

“Great Elder, it really was Mr. Chen. Don’t let his Fifth Grade Loose Immortal aura fool you, his true strength could crush you!” Yun Wuya said.

After the shock, the Barbaric Ancient Clan’s members erupted with towering rage.

The leading elders unleashed the Barbaric Ancient Clan’s secret treasures—black iron spiked clubs, bloodthirsty bone spears, sky-shaking beast hide shields—unleashing a barrage of wild, domineering attacks towards Chen Ping.

“Parlour tricks,” Chen Ping snorted coldly, not even bothering to draw his Dragon-Slaying Sword. Golden light flared around him, his Unbreakable Golden Body activating automatically.
