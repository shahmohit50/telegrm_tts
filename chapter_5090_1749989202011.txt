Title: Son Of The Dragon Chapter 5090


			
The golden and black lights clashed violently in midair, forming a massive energy vortex, the surrounding air shredded into nothingness, the lake water sucked from its bed, exposing dark silt.
Liuli City’s protective array trembled under this force, faint cracks appearing in the sky.

While Chen Ping battled the Great Elder, Sang Lan hurriedly returned to Shura Hall!

She needed her father to emerge from seclusion and stop the Great Elder’s actions!

Whether the Great Elder killed Chen Ping or not, it would be a heavy blow to Shura Hall!
If Chen Ping killed the Great Elder, Shura Hall would lose a powerful figure.

But if the Great Elder killed Chen Ping, Shura Hall would provoke an unknown, terrifying enemy.
Either way, Shura Hall gained nothing!

“Father, Father…” Sang Lan knelt before a secret chamber, shouting loudly!
Soon, the chamber slowly opened, and an old man stepped out, dressed in ornate robes, his hair and beard pure white, looking very kind.

“Lan’er, why urgently call me from seclusion?” the Shura Hall Master asked.
“Father, Shura Hall is in trouble…” Sang Lan recounted everything to her father!

Yet, upon hearing of Sang Kun and Sang Qi’s deaths, the old man’s expression didn’t change.
“A third-grade Loose Immortal, how could he have such strength?”

“And he even shattered the phantom of Tianyuan Pavilion’s Master, such audacity?”
The Shura Hall Master’s eyes narrowed slightly.

“Father, I suspect Chen Ping has a terrifying force behind him…” Sang Lan said.
“How terrifying could it be? At most, a Third Heaven power,” the Shura Hall Master said with a faint smile, “If I wished to go to the Third Heaven, I could at any time.”

“Father, then why haven’t you gone to the Third Heaven?” Sang Lan asked, puzzled.
“Better to be the head of a chicken than the tail of a phoenix, you wouldn’t understand.”

“In the Second Heaven, our Shura Hall is a top force, but in the Third Heaven, we’d be insignificant.”
The Shura Hall Master explained.

“I see!” Sang Lan nodded.
“Tell me more about this Chen Ping,” the Shura Hall Master said.

“Father, though he’s a third-grade Loose Immortal, his strength likely matches a sixth-grade, maybe even a seventh-grade Loose Immortal.”
“And he possesses many treasures, especially that sword, definitely a supreme treasure…”

“He’s also skilled in array techniques, quite proficient, and in those ruins, only he obtained valuable items.”
“Two coffins, two warrior statues, and in the ruins, those statues attacked others but not him.”

“So I suspect his bloodline is special, and he must have a powerful force backing him, otherwise, he wouldn’t dare disrespect us.”
Sang Lan analysed carefully, convinced Chen Ping was no ordinary person!

“Third Heaven?” The Shura Hall Master frowned slightly, “But a third-grade Loose Immortal couldn’t reach the Third Heaven!”
“I’m not sure, but that sword of his is definitely not something from below the Third Heaven.”

“That sword seems infused with a special bloodline, brimming with spiritual energy, clearly possessing an independent sword spirit.”
“He might come from a higher realm, fallen to our Third Heaven for some special reason.”

In Sang Lan’s mind, Chen Ping was no ordinary figure, surely with a significant background!
As for why he only showed third-grade Loose Immortal strength, there might be other reasons!

“Perhaps you’re right, take me to see him…” The Shura Hall Master nodded!
Soon, the father and daughter’s figures gradually vanished!
